# Education 

My road with education has been an interesting one, ever since i've known i have always been interested in programming and the internet and as such it was only obvious for me to follow that road, starting in **[highschool](https://www.damiaodegoes.pt/)** where i learned Computer Science for 3 years and learned the very basics of programming, web design and database management.

After those 3 years i took a 1 year break to further pursue one of my internships as a possible full time job, it was fun but the next year i realized that i still needed more education if i planned on competing on today's market and so i decided to follow up with a **[Polytechnic Institute](https://siesgt.ipsantarem.pt/esgt/cursos_geral.formview?p_cur_sigla=TSPSI)**!

Sadly this was in the middle of the Covid pandemic which took it's toll on mental health all around the world, all in all i did the 3 years and internship with perfect marks but ended up not truly finishing the course due to mental health issues, thankfully with support from a great psychologist and my family i have worked on those problems and evolved as a person!

# Professional Experience 

Most of my professional experience has been acquired through internships during my education years, during my highschool internship i chose to join the REBIS team, a company that mainly works with SAP Analytics, it was a very different experience from what i had been used to at the time but i got to work in a great team and even directly work with companies like NOS.

My second internship was more focused on the proper programming aspect and had a pretty different approach, it was on the company CAPENSIS and unlike REBIS it was fully focused on development and programming, i was in a team of 2 with a senior developer and everyday i got to experiment and discover new technologies, it was a very casual and relaxed environment but it showed me greater depths of the programming world which i could have ever only imagined at that point.

Aside from those internships i have mainly worked oddjobs, for a month i worked part-time at my local Worten in Castanheira do Ribatejo where i had to directly communicate and sell to the end client, i surprisingly liked it.

Right now i'm working at Italagro (HIT) for the tomato campaign which is a consideraly physically demanding job compared to every previous one.

# Technical Competences

Throughout all the years web devlopment was always one of the main points of interest of my education, and as such i have pretty good knowledge of HTML, css, Javascript, PHP and SQL, I have also dabbled with React and Vue while in my second internship but i would only classify myself as a basic user.

Aside from web design i have experience in C, Java, Python and Lua, ordered from best to worst, then i also have plenty of general skills acquired from being accostumed with computers, whether that be basic office app usage, photoshop or virtual machines with Linux distributions.
